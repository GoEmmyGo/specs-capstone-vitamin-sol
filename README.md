# **SPECS CAPSTONE MVP**

## **VITAMIN SOL**

If you're finding yourself feeling down, chances are a dose of vitamin D from the sun would do you some good. 

Vitamin Sol is an simple web app that uses a weather API and input from the user to perform a calculation that will determine how many minutes in the sun they need to get a full dose of vitamin D and hopefully wander into a slightly better headspace.

## **SITE FEATURES**

The site will consist of a landing page with an about blurb, possibly a breakdown of the science. Also thinking about incorporating a page for further reading with links to google scholar articles regarding vitamin D's role in mental and physical well-being, maybe even sunscreen suggestions.

The main page will include either an interctive map and an assoerment apparel examples to choose from before initializing a calculation and producing the number of minutes each user needs in the sun. 

## **FEATURE FAIRY DREAMS**

May provide a page for user to sign up for reminders to step outside if they are short on time that day using twilio. 

May also provide a login feature for tracking moods or daily reminders to get some sunshine.
